# Emotion Escape

A web game where you use your emotions to choose your own adventure.

The emotions are detected using a model [trained on AffectNet](https://www.kaggle.com/code/edwardjross/affectnet-resnet-fastai/) using [fastai](https://fast.ai).
The model is hosted in a [huggingface space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/edwardjross/fastai_emotion_classifier).
