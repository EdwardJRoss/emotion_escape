    <h1>About Emotion Escape</h1>
    <p>
    The game recognises your emotion from your facial expression using a neural network trained.
    This might sound complicated, but it doesn't require a heap of maths, code, or compute.
    It was trained on 500 images of each expression using a <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mouadriali/affectnetsample">sample of AffectNet</a>, a labelled dataset of facial expressions (some of which are pretty noisy).
    These were trained in a few lines of code using <a href="https://fast.ai">fastai</a> using material from the first chapter of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Coders-fastai-PyTorch/dp/1492045527">fastai book</a> or the first lesson of the <a href="https://course.fast.ai/">fastai courese</a>.
    The training was done using free compute using a <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/edwardjross/affectnet-resnet-fastai/">Kaggle notebook</a>, and is hosted freely as a <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/edwardjross/fastai_emotion_classifier">huggingface space</a>.
