    <h1>Emotion Escape</h1>
    <p>
    Emotion escape is a choose-your-own adventure game where you control your path by uploading a photo of your face expressing an emotion.
    The game recognises 5 emotions: happy, sad, fear, anger, and disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
    The game recognises your emotion from your facial expression using a neural network trained in [fastai](https://fast.ai).
    This might sound complicated but it [doesn't require a lot of code](https://www.kaggle.com/code/edwardjross/affectnet-resnet-fastai/).
